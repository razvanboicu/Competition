# Competition-project
<b> A multi-client application that allows the management of any kind of competition. </b>

## Short-description

Competitors participate in a competition. Each competitor is part of a team (one and only one). <br>
A team can have between a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 5 competitors. <br>
The competition administrator plans the stages (each stage is attended by competitors, not teams). <br>
At the end of each stage, the participating competitors register a score (which does not have to be unique compared to the rest of the participants in the stage).<br>
Only the competitor can register his own score (not the administrator) and cannot be modified. <br>
A stage is considered completed after all registered competitors pass the corresponding score. <br>
The administrator can communicate to the candidates who did not register their score to do so. <br>
Each competitor, but also the administrator, can see the ranking according to the stages already completed (those that have all the scores), individually and in teams. <br>
If there are several competitors on the same place, each one will receive the arithmetic mean of the cumulative score for the places. <br>
